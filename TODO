Editor / pager as unique tool
________________________________________________________________________________

	Do one thing and do it well.  Reading and editing text is the same
	thing, so to do both of these, we need a single tool.

	Displaying a buffer of lines on a screen, with apropriate width, and
	height according to the terminal.  The editor support all of this, as
	do the pager, so the pager gets useless while an editor is out there.


Not expanding tabs to space in interface
________________________________________________________________________________

	Just display tabs as is and make nums at the left shift text either 0
	if not displayed, or 8 if displayed.

	This will only cause issue if:

	1	The buffer has 10 000 000 lines or more.

	2	It has a tab after a multiple of 7 characters.

	3	This very same line is larger than the width of the screen.

	It is then a remarkably rare event, reason why I do not need to support
	it.


Line-based history
________________________________________________________________________________

	For every change, remove the changed / deleted line from the buffer,
	then add these lines to an array of charges, containing buffers.

	For changed lines, duplicate the line and apply the changes on this new
	line, so than the previous line keeps its state.


Auto-indentation
________________________________________________________________________________

	Simple, language-independent auto indentation, with tabs support:
	if a tab is not at the beginning of a line, consider it as a bullet
	mark, and indent the rest of the text to this level (with only one
	tab).
	
	That is, add the same number of tabs to the next line as the one in
	the current line while adding a line.

	Do not promote anything else than tab for indentation, so do not
	support space for indentation, exception for some LISP mode if it
	ever comes.


Directory structure
________________________________________________________________________________

	Use standard "$XDG_USER_DIRS" directories.


$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/editor/rc


$XDG_CACHE_HOME/editor/clipboard/[0-9a-z]

	One plain clipboard file per register, alnum only (+ one for delete
	register?).


$XDG_CACHE_HOME/editor/commands

	Plain text history of ':' commands, most recent last.


$XDG_CACHE_HOME/editor/searches

	Plain text history of '/' and '?' searches, most recent last.


$XDG_CACHE_HOME/editor/marks

	Plain text history of text marks, in the format "filename:line:column"

	As we support reading this format, perhaps always read file as if they
	were in this format.


$XDG_CACHE_HOME/editor/backups/.+/[0-9]+

	".+" directory is the name of every file ever open in the editor,
	with the '/' replaced by '!', and "$HOME" replaced by '~'.
	In it, diffs for every save, eventually generated by the editor
	itself, but more probably by a diff command.


Options
________________________________________________________________________________

	Use a single int with binary operations: "or" to set and "and" to get.

	OPT_XYZ  =  0b00...010...00
	              ^     ^-------    Current option switch.
	              '---------------  Add new ones at the left.
	              '-----.-----'
	                    '---------  Total number of options.


autoindent

	This is the only option to switch while willing to paste some text.


textwidth

	Width for autowrap, colorcolumn...


colorcolumn
